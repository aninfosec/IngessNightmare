## üî• CVE-2025-1974 Overview

**CVE-2025-1974** is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the **Kubernetes Ingress-NGINX Controller**. It allows an **unauthenticated attacker** to execute **arbitrary code inside the Ingress controller pod**, by abusing how custom annotations are processed during NGINX config reloads.

### Root Cause

Ingress-NGINX supports annotations like `auth-url` that get inserted into the live NGINX config. An attacker can smuggle **NGINX directives** using crafted annotation values (e.g., `ssl_engine`) which get injected into the config and are **executed during validation**.

When the `nginx -t` test validates a malicious `ssl_engine` directive pointing to a temporary uploaded `.so` file, NGINX tries to **dynamically load and execute** it via OpenSSL, causing **arbitrary code execution**.

## üß† Exploit Summary

This exploit works in **two phases**:

1. **Upload Phase**  
   A `.so` payload (compiled shared library) is uploaded to the NGINX ingress controller using a crafted POST request that **triggers NGINX buffering**, keeping the file open via a file descriptor (FD).

2. **Trigger Phase**  
   The attacker brute-forces `/proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>` combinations by sending forged `AdmissionReview` requests to the **admission webhook**, injecting a malicious `auth-url` that contains:
   ```nginx
   ssl_engine /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>;
